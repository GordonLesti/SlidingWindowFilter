\subsubsection{Time Series Normalization} \label{time_series_normalization}
When using DTW to determine the similarity of two time series, it is a common approach to z-normalize or Z-score the
time series in front of the calculation \cite{ding2008querying}. In \cite{das1998rule} two different time series
normalizations are presented. Both time series normalizations $\eta$ and $\eta '$ are explained in the following
section.

Given is a time series $Q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_i, \dots, q_l)$ with length $l$ over the domain set $\mathbb{U}$ and a
distance measure function $d$ with $d: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$. The first time series normalization
$\eta$ transforms every data
point of the given time series $Q$ as follows.
\begin{equation}
    \eta (q) = q -\bar{q}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{q}$ is the mean of the time series $Q$
\begin{equation}
    \bar{q} = \frac{1}{l} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{l} q_i
\end{equation}

The second time series normalization $\eta '$ transforms every data point of the given time series $Q$ as follows.
\begin{equation}
    \eta '(q) = \frac{\eta (q)}{\sigma}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the time series $Q$
\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{1}{l-1} \sum \limits_{i=1}^{l} d(q_i, \bar{q})^2
\end{equation}
