\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

As time goes by things change, and those who understand change can adapt accordingly. This basic principle is also reflected in today's digital society, where sensor-equipped devices measure our environment and online algorithms inform humans or other machines about relevant trends and events. Applications range from gesture recognition for human-computer interaction \cite{liu2009uwave} over event detection for smart home controll \cite{spiegel2015metering} to frequent pattern mining for engine optimization \cite{spiegel2015driving} and scene detection in video content \cite{acar2011mediaeval} . \\
