\subsection{Data Preparation} \label{data_preparation}

All recorded data were quantized before evaluation. The authors of \cite{liu2009uwave} have two reasons for that,
the length of the time series were reduced for DTW in order to improve computation efficiency and the recorded time
series was transformed with a stable time gab between the data points.

\paragraph{Compressing} The recorded acceleration data were compressed to an average value for a window size of 50
ms and a step length of 30 ms.

\paragraph{Conversion} The compressed records are converted into 33 different integer levels between -16 and 16 as done
in \cite{liu2009uwave}.
