\section{Conclusion and Future Work} \label{conclusion_and_future_work}

In this work we have proposed a novel sliding window filter for more efficient event detection in time series streams, which replaces computational expensive dissimilarity comparisons by less demanding statistical measures. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the developed filter is able to recognize gestures in continuous streams of acceleration data with high accuracy, while cutting the number of distance calculations in half. 

Possible applications do not only include event detection on mobile device with few hardware resources, but also distributed sensor networks with limited bandwidth that communicate high level information instead of transferring raw data. In future work we plan to investigate a larger variety of statistical measures that exhibit favorable filtering properties for online gesture recognition as well as data streams found in other domains.
