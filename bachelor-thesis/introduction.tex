\section{Introduction}
The scenario is an application that gets constantly data in form of a time series stream from one or more sensors. The
application itself has in general no interest in a long term evaluation of the data. Only the most recent time series
window has to be classified in the evaluation. The result of the evaluation will be stored or processed by an other
application, the time series window moves on and has to be evaluated again. This process is repeating continuously.
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in combination with a 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1NN) classification for the evaluation is an
obvious approach for such a scenario. The downside, this approach is computationally too demanding for many realtime
applications \cite{xi2006fast}. This disadvantage becomes even more tragic under the assumption that perhaps a large
amout of incoming time series windows may cross a certain threshold to their nearest neighbour to be classified. Shall
mean that not every incoming time series window can be matched to a class.

This bachelor thesis explains the approach of a filter for time series in front of the 1NN in combination with DTW
(1NN-DTW) to reduce the execution of 1NN-DTW on unclassifiable time series windows. The condition for such a filter is
linear complexity.
