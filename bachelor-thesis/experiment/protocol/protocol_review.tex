\subsubsection{Protocol Review} \label{protocol_review}
The presented protocol in section \ref{protocol} combined with the recording software in section \ref{recording} has
been created in front of this bachelor thesis and the experiment was performed while writing this thesis. Unfortunately
has the protocol some weaknesses that occurred during the experiment or while evaluating the produced data.

\paragraph{Training Data Quantity} The protocol contains only 8 instances of training gestures for 8 different classes.
That made the determination of a threshold for a class very difficult. It would have been better to produce at least two
or better three instances of a gesture for every class.

\paragraph{Gesture Illustration Size} It was confusing for some experimentess that the gestures on the slides (j) to (q)
had an other size as the gestures on slide (b) to (i) of figure \ref{fig:slides}. The recording had to be repeated,
cause the experimentess performed the gesture scaled to the illustration size on the slide.

\paragraph{Similar Gestures} While designing the protocol and the containing gestures care was taken to medium complex
gestures that differ well from one another. This has worked well for the most part, but the evaluation has shown that
gesture \textit{GesD} and \textit{GesH} are very similar. It would have been better to flip gesture \textit{GesH}
horizontally.

Changing the protocol during the bachelor thesis due to the above mentioned weaknesses was no option.
