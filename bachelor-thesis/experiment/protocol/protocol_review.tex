\subsubsection{Protocol Review} \label{protocol_review}
The presented protocol in section \ref{protocol} combined with the recording software in section \ref{recording} has
been created in front of this bachelor thesis and the experiment was performed while writing this thesis. Unfortunately
has the protocol some weaknesses that occurred during the experiment or while evaluating the produced data.

\paragraph{Test data quantity} The protocol contains only 8 different test gestures for 8 different classes. That made
the determination of a threshold for a class very difficult. It would have been better to produce at least two or better
three instances of a gesture for every class.

\paragraph{Gesture illustration size} It was confusing for some experimentess that the gestures on the slides (j) to (q)
had an other size as the gestures on slide (b) to (i) of figure \ref{fig:slides}. The recording had to be repeated,
cause the experimentess performed the gesture scaled to the illustration size on the slide.

Changing the protocol during the bachelor thesis due to the above mentioned weaknesses was no option.
