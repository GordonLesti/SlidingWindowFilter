\paragraph{Time Series Distance Measures} \label{time_series_distance_measures}
DTW has proven in \cite{liu2009uwave} that it works for time series as accelerometer based gesture detection. The
following distance measure functions for time series have been tested. Every different version for the distanc measure
was tested with 34 different sizes of the Sakoe-Chiba band.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DTW:} Plain DTW as explained in section \ref{dynamic_time_warping}.
    \item \textbf{$\eta$DTW:} DTW with $\eta$ normalization as explained in section \ref{time_series_normalization}.
    \item \textbf{$\eta '$DTW:} DTW with $\eta '$ normalization as explained in section \ref{time_series_normalization}.
\end{itemize}
