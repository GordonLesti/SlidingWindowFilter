\paragraph{Step Size Determination} \label{step_size_determination}
The Step Size Determination is also not trivial. A oversized step size is very likely to produce more false negative
classifications, but leads to a reduced execution of 1NN calls. Too small step sizes on the other hand can overuse the
1NN calls. In this experiment the step size is set to one tenth of the window size in view of an huge set of combinable
parameters for a simulation.
