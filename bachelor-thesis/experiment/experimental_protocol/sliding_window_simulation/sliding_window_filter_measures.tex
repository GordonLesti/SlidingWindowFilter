\paragraph{Sliding Window Filter Measures} \label{sliding_window_filter_measures}
The sliding window filter is already explained in section \ref{sliding_window_filter}. The following time series
measures were tested as underlying measures for the sliding window filter.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LNCE:} The length normalized CE as mentioned in \ref{complexity_estimate}.
    \item \textbf{VAR:} The Sample Variance as mentioned in \ref{sample_variance}.
\end{itemize}
The passing filter interval of every filter was tested with eleven different factors that increase the interval
from 100\% to maximum 300\%.
