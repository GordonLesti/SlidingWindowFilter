\subsubsection{Labeled Generic Time Series Model} \label{labeled_generic_time_series_model}
A generic time series model was created for the evaluating software. A generic time series over the domain set
$\mathbb{U}$ will be a linked list of data points. Those data points are containing a generic data object and an
optional label. The generic object has to be an element of the domain set $\mathbb{U}$. In the case of the carried out
experiment a data point contains the acceleration data of the x-axis, the y-axis and z-axis. So $\mathbb{U}$ will be
similar to $\mathbb{Z}^3$ or better $\mathbb{R}^3$. $\mathbb{U}$ will be the set of vectors containing three integer
values and the distance function $d$ on $\mathbb{U}$ will be the eucliean distance
$\sqrt[2]{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2}$. The generic approach for the implemented time series model
and the time series measures should make it easier to evaluate similar experiments on other domains. A label of a data
point will be used to mark a data point as part of a gesture.
