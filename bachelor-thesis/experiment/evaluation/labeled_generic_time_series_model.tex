\subsubsection{Labeled Generic Time Series Model} \label{labeled_generic_time_series_model}
A generic time series model was created for the evaluating software. A generic time series over the domain set
$\mathbb{U}$ will be a linked list of data points. Those data points are containing a generic object and optional label.
The generic object has to be an element of the domain set $\mathbb{U}$. In the case of the carried out experiment a
data point contains the acceleration data of the x-axis, the y-axis and z-axis. So $\mathbb{U}$ will be similar to
$\mathbb{Z}^3$. The generic approach for the implemented time series model and the time series measures should make it
easier to evaluate similar experiments on other domains. A label of a data point will be used to mark a data point as
part of a gesture.
