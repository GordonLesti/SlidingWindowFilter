\paragraph{Time Series Distance Measures} \label{time_series_distance_measures}
DTW has proven in \cite{liu2009uwave} that it works for time series as accelerometer based gesture detection. The
following distance measure functions for time series have been tested.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DTW:} Plain DTW as explained in section \ref{dynamic_time_warping}.
    \item \textbf{NDTW:} DTW with normalization.
\end{itemize}
