\paragraph{Window Size Determination} \label{window_size_determination}
The determination of the used window size is not trivial. An oversized or too small window can lead to many false
negative classifications. Four pretty basic approaches based on the length of the training data have been tested.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maximum:} This approach takes the length from the longest time series of the training data.
    \item \textbf{Minimum:} This approach takes the length from the shortest time series of the training data.
    \item \textbf{Average:} This approach takes the average length from all time series of the training data.
    \item \textbf{Middle:} This approach takes the average length from the longest and the shortest time series of the
    training data.
\end{itemize}
