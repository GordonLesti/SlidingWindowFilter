\paragraph{Influence of Sakoe-Chiba Band Size} \label{influence_of_sakoe-chiba_band_size}
The positive influence of the Sakoe-Chiba band size for the performance of a simulation in the experiment is verified by
table \ref{tab:result}. The most dominating configurations are using a band size with 24\% of the input time series.
It appears not effective to compare all different tested band sizes on a huge subset as done by comparing the time
series measures.
