\subsubsection{Gesture Notation} \label{gesture_notation}
The \textit{clockwise circle} gesture of slide (b) and (j) in figure \ref{fig:slides} is abbreviated with $GesA$, the
\textit{flipped Z} gesture on slide (c) and (k) of figure \ref{fig:slides} is abbreviated with $GesB$ and so on until
the \textit{W} gesture of slide (i) and (q) in figure \ref{fig:slides} shortened with $GesH$.

As the experiment was executed by different experimentees, a instance of gesture $GesC$ performed by the fourth
experimentee on slide (d) of figure \ref{fig:slides} will be abbreviated as $exp_{4}.GesC_{1}$. The same gesture by the
same experimentee on slide (l) of figure \ref{fig:slides} will be abbreviated as $exp_{4}.GesC_{2}$.
