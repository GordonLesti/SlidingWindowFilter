\subsection{Complexity-Invariant Distance Measure}
The complexity-invariant distance measure \cite{batista2011complexity} or shorten $CID$ is a distance measure for time
series. It is composed of the euclidean distance or shorten $ED$ and a complexity correction factor or shorten $CF$.

Given are a time series $S$ of size $n$ and a time series $T$ of size $m$ over the set $\mathbb{U}$. Furthermore is
$n = m$ and a distance measure function $D$ on the set $\mathbb{U}$ with
$D: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$ is given.
\begin{center}
    $CID(S, T) = ED(S, T) \times CF(S, T)$
\end{center}
with complexity correction factor
\begin{center}
    $CF(S, T) = \frac{max(CE(S), CE(T))}{min(CE(S), CE(T))}$
\end{center}
$CE$ is a complexity estimate of a time series and a possible implementation can be
\begin{center}
    $CE(S) = \sqrt{\sum \limits_{i=1}^{n-1} D(s_i, s_{i + 1})^2}$
\end{center}
