\section{Experiment}
An experiment was carried out to examine the possible added value of a time series filter. The experiment was inspired
by \textit{uWave: Accelerometer-based personalized gesture recognition and its applications} \cite{liu2009uwave}. Ten
experimentees including the author of this thesis have participated in the experiment. An experimenee had to perform a
mix of gestures with a Wii Remote\texttrademark~Plus\footnote{https://www.nintendo.com/} controller and physical
activities instructed by a graphical interface. Figure~\ref{fig:wii-remote} shows a Wii Remote\texttrademark~Plus
controller.
