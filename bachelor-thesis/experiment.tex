\section{Experiment} \label{experiment}
An experiment was carried out to examine the possible added value of a time series filter. A instance of this experiment
consists of two parts, the recording of training data gestures and a repetition of those gestures mixed with physical
activities. The first part served the training data for 1NN-DTW and the second part will be the simulated time series
stream. The experiment was inspired by \cite{liu2009uwave}. Fourteen experimentees including the author of this thesis
have participated in the experiment. An experimentee had to perform a mix of gestures with a Wii
Remote\texttrademark~Plus\footnote{https://www.nintendo.com/ Wii U is a trademark of Nintendo.} controller and physical
activities instructed by a graphical user interface. Figure~\ref{fig:wii-remote} shows a Wii Remote\texttrademark~Plus
controller.
