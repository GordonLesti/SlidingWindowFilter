\section{Background and Notation} \label{background_and_notation}
A time series $S$ with the length $l$ over the domain set $\mathbb{U}$ is a sequence of data points
$S = (s_1, s_2, \dots, s_i, \dots, s_l)$ with $s_i \in \mathbb{U}$. On the set $\mathbb{U}$ exists a distance measure
function $D$ with $D: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$. A common assumption for time series is that the
containing data points are elements of the integer numbers $\mathbb{Z}$ or the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. The distance
measure function on these common domains is just the absolute value of the difference of two elements. A fundamental
prerequisite for distance measure function on time series is often the distance measure function $D$ on the set
$\mathbb{U}$. Table~\ref{tab:notation} explains the basic variables that are used in this bachelor thesis.
