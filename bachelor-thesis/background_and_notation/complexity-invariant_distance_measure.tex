\subsection{Complexity-Invariant Distance Measure} \label{complexity-invariant_distance_measure}
The Complexity-Invariant Distance measure \cite{batista2011complexity} (CID) is a distance measure for time
series. It is composed of the ED and a Complexity Correction Factor (CF).

% Given are a time series $S$ of size $n$ and a time series $T$ of size $m$ over the set $\mathbb{U}$. Furthermore is
% $n = m$ and a distance measure function $D$ on the set $\mathbb{U}$ with
% $D: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$ is given.
% \begin{center}
%     $CID(S, T) = ED(S, T) \times CF(S, T)$
% \end{center}
% with complexity correction factor
% \begin{center}
%     $CF(S, T) = \frac{max(CE(S), CE(T))}{min(CE(S), CE(T))}$
% \end{center}
% $CE$ is a complexity estimate of a time series and a possible implementation can be
% \begin{center}
%     $CE(S) = \sqrt[2]{\sum \limits_{i=1}^{n-1} D(s_i, s_{i + 1})^2}$
% \end{center}
