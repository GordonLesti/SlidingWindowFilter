\subsection{Complexity Estimate} \label{complexity_estimate}
The Complexity Estimate (CE) is a complexity measure for time series and the authors of \cite{batista2011complexity}
introduced one possible approach of a CE implementation. Given is a time series $Q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_i, \dots, q_l)$
with length $l$ over the domain set $\mathbb{U}$ and a distance measure function $d$ with
$d: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$.

\begin{equation}
    CE(Q) = \sqrt[2]{\sum \limits_{i=1}^{l-1} d(q_i, q_{i + 1})^2}
\end{equation}

The CE would be a suitable time series measure for a measure based filter as mentioned in \ref{sliding_window_filter}.
But the measure has been created in \cite{batista2011complexity} under the assumption that two time series have the same
length. Therefore a length normalized version of CE fits better as underlying time series measure for a filter. The
length normalized CE (LNCE) can be calculated as follows.

\begin{equation}
    LNCE(Q) = \frac{1}{l-1}CE(Q)
\end{equation}
