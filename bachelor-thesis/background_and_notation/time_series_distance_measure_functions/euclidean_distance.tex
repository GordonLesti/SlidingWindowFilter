\subsubsection{Euclidean Distance}
A basic distance measure function on time series is the euclidean distance or shorten $ED$.
\begin{center}
    $ED(S, T) = \sqrt[2]{\sum \limits_{i=1}^{n} D(s_i, t_i)^2}$
\end{center}
Two time series of the the same length are required for the euclidean distance. The smaller time series has to be
streched or the longer time series has to be compressed.
