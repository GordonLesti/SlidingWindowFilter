\subsubsection{Complexity-Invariant Dynamic Time Warping} \label{complexity-invariant_dynamic_time_warping}
Strictly speaking is the CF himself a similarity measure for time series, however certainly better suited as factor in
combination with an other similarity measure. Complexity-Invariant Dynamic Time Warping (CIDDTW) is the combination of
CF with DTW \cite{batista2011complexity}.

Given are two time series $Q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_i, \dots, q_l)$ with length $l$,
$C = (c_1, c_2, \dots, c_j, \dots, c_k)$ with length $k$ over the domain set $\mathbb{U}$ and a distance measure
function $D$ with $D: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$. The CIDDTW distance between time series $Q$ and $C$
can be calculated with the following formula.

\begin{center}
    $CIDDTW(Q, C) = DTW(Q, C) \times CF(Q, C)$
\end{center}
