\subsection{Sliding Window Technique} \label{sliding_window_technique}
Given is a continous time series data stream $Q$. The last subsequence of size $w$ is in the interest of the sliding
window technique. All subsequences or time series data points of $Q$ that are further back as the window size $w$ are in
this moment irrelevant. The sliding window application tries to classify this last subsequence of $Q$ with the 1NN-DTW
approach. It is possible that the current subsequence is unclassifiable due to a too large DTW distance between the
subsequence and the nearest neighbour. This task is managed by a predefined threshold value $\epsilon$ that works as
upper bound for the DTW distance. The application will trigger an event in the case of a positive classification of the
subsequence and an other application can react on this event. The sliding window application itself will wait until the
time series data stream $Q$ grows on. Afterwards the process is repeated again. However the sliding window apllication
will wait until the time series data stream $Q$ has grown by a predefined step size $s$. This can avoid the execution
of the process continuously after every new data point in $Q$ if necessary. Figure \ref{fig:swt} illustrates the
described process.
