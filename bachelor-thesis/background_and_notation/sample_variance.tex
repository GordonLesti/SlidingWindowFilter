\subsection{Sample Variance} \label{sample_variance}
The sample variance based on \cite{chan1983algorithms}. Given is a time series
$Q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_i, \dots, q_l)$ with length $l > 0$ over the domain set $\mathbb{U}$ and a distance measure
function $d$ with $d: \mathbb{U} \times \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}$. The variance of a time series $Q$ can be
calculated by the following formula.
\begin{equation}
    VAR(Q) = \frac{1}{l}\sum \limits_{i=1}^{l} d(q_i, \bar{q})^2
\end{equation}
where $\bar{q}$ is the mean of the time series $Q$ as mentioned in \ref{time_series_normalization}. The sample variance
is also a promising candidate as time series measure for a measure based filter.
