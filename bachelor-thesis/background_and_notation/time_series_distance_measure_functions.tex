\subsection{Time Series Distance Measure Functions}
This section introduces some distance measure functions for time series over the set $\mathbb{U}$. The requirement for
every distance measure function between two timeseries over the set $\mathbb{U}$ is always a distance measure function
$D$ on the set $\mathbb{U}$.
