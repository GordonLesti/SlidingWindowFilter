\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{Sliding Window Simulation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More than 72\% of gestures were found right

        \item Less than 4\% of gestures were wrongly detected
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{Sliding Window Filter}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 13\% of blocked 1NN-DTW calls without losing accuracy

        \item cutting the number of distance calculations in half with losing not noticeable amount of accuracy
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item investigate a larger variety of statistical measures

        \item data streams found in other domains
    \end{itemize}
