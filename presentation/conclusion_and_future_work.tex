\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{Sliding Window Simulation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More than 72\% of gestures were found right
        \pause
        \item Less than 4\% of gestures were wrongly detected
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}{Sliding Window Filter}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 13\% of blocked 1NN-DTW calls without losing accuracy
        \pause
        \item 39\% of blocked 1NN-DTW calls with losing not noticeable amount of accuracy
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rerun the experiment with more training gestures
        \pause
        \item A web based experiment for more participation
        \pause
        \item Rerun the experiment in other domains
        \pause
        \item Different filter intervals for different gesture classes
    \end{itemize}
