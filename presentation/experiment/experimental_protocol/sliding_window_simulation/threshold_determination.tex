    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{HMinD:} Half minimum distance, determines the threshold for a class by the
            half minimum distance of the class to all other classes in the training data
        \pause
        \item \textbf{HAveD:} Half average distance, determines the threshold for a class by the
            half average distance of the class to all other classes in the training data
        \pause
        \item \textbf{HMidD:} Half middle distance, determines the threshold for a class by the
            half average of the minimum and maximum distance of the class to all other classes in the training data
        \pause
        \item \textbf{Peak:} Peaking, fakes already generated knowledge about the distance
            threshold
